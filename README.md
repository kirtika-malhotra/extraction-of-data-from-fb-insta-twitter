# extraction of data from instagram using unofficial instagramAPI
Data extraction is a process that involves retrieval of data from various sources. Frequently, companies extract data in order to process it further, migrate the data to a data repository (such as a data warehouse or a data lake) or to further analyze it. It’s common to transform the data as a part of this process. For example, you might want to perform calculations on the data — such as aggregating sales data — and store those results in the data warehouse. If you are extracting the data to store it in a data warehouse, you might want to add additional metadata or enrich the data with timestamps or geolocation data. Finally, you likely want to combine the data with other data in the target data store. These processes, collectively, are called ETL, or Extraction, Transformation, and Loading. Extraction is the first key step in this process.
